##What I learned how to do from this project:

Set up a raspberry pi

Use a raspberry pi (major pain to figure this out for the first time)

Set up processing on a raspberry pi

Install arduino and firmata on a raspberry pi for use in processing

Compare previous and current video frames in processing

Initialize webcam usage on a raspberry pi

How to Use firmata for I2C communication

How to use the adafruit motorshield for dc motors

How to use Michael and J.D. as resources

How to use an H-bridge in place of a shield

Using arduino without libraries sucks

How to get an arduino and Raspberry pi to communication through serial and firmata

I got a new appreciation for processing, which I really did not like before

I sorta learned how to use millis() instead of delay(THIS IS HUGE)

##Moving Forwards

I plan on getting comfortable with raspberry pi, and want to use it for projects. IF there is one thing that I got from this class, it is that I shouldn't think of projects in a sense of what can be accomplished with arduino, but rather keep and open mind for other methods of execution.

##Side note: 

I was one of three students out of our whole class who actually showed up to the Interface Show
