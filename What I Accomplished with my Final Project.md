##What I learned how to do from this project:

-Set up a raspberry pi
-Set up processing on a raspberry pi
-Install arduino and firmata on a raspberry pi for use in processing
-Compare previous and current video frames in processing
-Initialize webcam usage on a raspberry pi
-How to Use firmata for I2C communication
-How to use the adafruit motorshield for dc motors
-How to use Michael and J.D. as resources
-How to use an H-bridge in place of a shield
-Using arduino without libraries sucks
-How to get an arduino and Raspberry pi to communication through serial and firmata
-I got a new appreciation for processing, which I really did not like before
-I sorta learned how to use millis() instead of delay(THIS IS HUGE)
